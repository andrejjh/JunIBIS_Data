The Campaign of Belgium in 1815 marked the end of the Napoleonic wars. This dataset lists the armies and units in presence, their commanders and their hourly positions during the six days of campaign between June 15 and June 20. Maps and further details are available on [JunIBIS.be](http://www.junibis.be).

### Why was dataset created?
Fan of Napoleonic history, especially passionate for the First Empire wars, and poured into the area of ​​digital mapping, I wanted to create interactive maps depicting the Campaign of Belgium of June 1815. I quickly received help from a longtime friend whose book knowledge wisely complement my computer skills. The abundant literature on the subject allowed us to compile the troops movements during the first days of the campaign.

The three founding principles of our project are: open data, free access and sources attribution. Our maps are available under CC-BY license that allows anyone «to copy, distribute and transmit the material by any means and in any format, to remix, transform and create from the equipment» under the attribution term : you must give appropriate credit and indicate if changes where made.

The interactive maps result of a meticulous work of analysis and compilation from many sources.

### When was it collected?
Dataset was assembled between Spring and Autumn 2015 when we developed the website.

### Which instruments used to collect it?
We did use open source software (Postgresql and QGIS) and did developed some SQL scripts and Ruby programs.
[Carto](https://carto.com/) is used to deliver all our final maps.

### What does "null" mean?
Null values mostly indicated not applicable, rarely unknown.

### Other comments
The units positions used in the interactive maps result of a meticulous work of analysis and compilation of many different sources. These referenced positions were than interpolated to generate hourly positions.
